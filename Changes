Revision history for Test-Mini

1.1.3_01 2015-07-24 NEILB
    - Converted all the documentation to traditional pod, from the Yard-based
      documentation that was used previously.
    - Set min perl version in all modules and dist metadata to 5.006.
      Previously Test::Mini required 5.008, but actually is fine with 5.006
    - Updated Makefile.PL and MANIFEST to a simpler more static model;
      this was made possible because Pieter is happy to drop use of Yard for
      the documentation.

v1.1.3 2011-02-13 PVANDE
    - Found a bug causing erroneous behavior for skipped tests in Perl 5.13+.

v1.1.2 2011-02-11 PVANDE
    - Fixed a bug in Makefile.PL that caused failures with older versions of
      ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

    - Added a proper $VERSION to the Test::Mini package.

v1.1.1 2010-10-15 PVANDE
    - Fixed a bug w.r.t. mro::get_isarev behavior.  Test::Mini would always
      try to run tests in any package that had ever been a subclass of
      Test::Mini::TestCase; this prevented Test::Mini::Unit's tests from
      passing under any Perl >= 5.9.5.  Few users will have seen this bug.

    - Made another pass at making t/Test/Mini/Logger.t pass on the smokers.

v1.1.0 2010-10-01 PVANDE
    - Implemented respect for the TEST_MINI_NO_AUTORUN environment variable

    - Fixed a bug where invalid TAP was output when running multiple test
      cases in a single process

    - Attempted once again to fix an intermittent failure in
      t/Test/Mini/Logger.t related to timings

1.0.0  2010-09-16
    - First Major Version
